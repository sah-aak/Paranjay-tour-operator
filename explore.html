        Named after an Elephant like stone at its foot, the Elephant Falls are amongst the most popular falls in the North-East, situated next to Shillong. It is a tourists' paradise with three layers of the falls accessible to the layman from different vantage points.

Elephant Waterfalls is a superb place for spending some time in the midst of nature while capturing the incredible moments for your keepsake.
